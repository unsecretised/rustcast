# Welcome to the RustCast contributing guide!

Thank you for wanting to contribute to RustCast!

There are 2 areas you can work on:

1. Bug fixes
1. New Features
1. Help people in solving their github issues

For bug fixes, and helping people to solve their github issues: see
[https://github.com/unsecretised/rustcast/issues] For features, see
[The Planned Features in the README](README.md) or
[The existing feature list](FEATURES.md)

## Code Guidelines:

1. All code must be formatted with `cargo fmt`
1. Code must not be malicious or be intended to harm someones device
1. All features added must work as intended
1. Code must compile...
1. A video recording / screenshot would be an added bonus in getting your pull
   request merged faster.
